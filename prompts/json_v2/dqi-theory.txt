[DQI THEORETICAL CONTEXT]
The DQI attempts to measure political deliberation in a general, valid and reliable way (Steenbergen et al. 2003). It mainly draws on Habermasian discourse ethics, but also incorporates elements of other deliberative models. The unit of analysis of the DQI is a speech act, i.e. the discourse by a particular individual delivered at a particular point in a debate. For each speech, we distinguish between relevant and irrelevant parts, and only the relevant parts are coded. A relevant part is one that contains a demand, i.e. a proposal on what decision should or should not be made. Our emphasis on demands stems from the fact that they constitute the heart of the deliberation. That is, demands stipulate what ought to be and what ought not to be, and this normative character puts them at the center of discourse ethics. The DQI is composed of seven indicators. Despite the considerable complexity of parliamentary debates, we attempt to keep the coding categories relatively easy, so as to ensure a high level of reliability. The following is an elaboration of these indicators, followed by an overview of the indicators and their codes. We discuss seven the seven indicators under four headings.

1. Participation. Participation constitutes a fundamental precondition for deliberation. In parliamentary settings of western democracies, this type of basic participation can usually be seen as given for the elected representatives. Normal participation is only assumed to be impaired if a speaker is cut off by a formal decision, or if she or he feels explicitly disturbed in the case of a verbal interruption by other actors.
2. Justification. Fruitful discourse requires the justification of assertions and validity claims. That is, assertions should be introduced and critically assessed through “the orderly exchange of information and grounds between parties” (Habermas 1992: 370). The major problem here is that since the ideal speech situation itself has no content, one cannot apply external standards to what constitutes a good reason; otherwise one would also predetermine the result of a discourse. Hence, we only judge to what extent a speech gives complete justifications for demands and thus makes it accessible to rational critique. The first indicator of the concept of justification is the level of the justification, whereby we distinguish between five levels. No justification forms the lowest level of the indicator. Next comes inferior justification, i.e., a conclusion is embedded in an incomplete inference (i.e., either the premise is not clear or the inference from premise to conclusion is invalid). The next level is qualified justification, where one conclusion is embedded in a complete inference (i.e., the premise is clear and the inference is valid). At the next level, sophisticated justification (broad), more than one conclusion is embedded in complete inferences. Finally, the highest level is sophisticated justification (in depth), where one or several conclusions are embedded in several complete inferences. The second indicator of justification is its content. Here, we distinguish four levels. The lowest level is explicit statement concerning constituency or group interests. The next level is a neutral statement, which either contains no reference to constituency or group interests or references to several group interests. The third level is an explicit statement in terms of a conception of the common good in utilitarian or collective terms. The highest level is an explicit statement in terms of the difference principle (Rawls 1971).
3. Respect. Respect for other participants is an essential feature of deliberation. We distinguish three types of respect. The first type is respect toward the group in general, or empathy, whereby speakers make explicit positive statements concerning the group to be helped. The second type of respect is respect toward demands, whereby speakers explicitly value or agree with the demands of others. The third type of respect is respect toward counterarguments, whereby speakers explicitly value or agree with counterarguments to their own position.
4. Constructive politics. Constructive politics is the notion that speakers go beyond mere positional politics, where they merely reiterate their own demands. Instead, they propose alternative solutions or mediating proposals, thus making an effort to build consensus. We distinguish four levels of constructive politics. The lowest level is positional politics, where speakers sit on their positions. The next level is alternative proposals, where speakers propose a different agenda. The third level is consensus appeal, where speakers make an unspecific appeal for compromise or consensus. The highest level is mediating proposals, where speakers make a proposal within the same agenda.
