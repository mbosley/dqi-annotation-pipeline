[PRIOR PROBABILITIES]
<prior_probabilities>
For each dimension, generate prior probabilities for each category based on your understanding of the theory, task, and examples. Present in a table like:

Dimension 1:
| Category | Prior Prob |
|----------|------------|
| Score 1  | ...%       |
| Score 2  | ...%       |
| ...      | ...        |

Dimension 2:
| Category | Prior Prob |
|----------|------------|
| Score 1  | ...%       |
| Score 2  | ...%       |
| ...      | ...        |

...
</prior_probabilities>

[EVIDENCE COLLECTION]
Collect quotes from the speech that are relevant to each dimension:

```xml
<dimension1_evidence>
Quotes related to dimension 1
</dimension1_evidence>

<dimension2_evidence>
Quotes related to dimension 2
</dimension2_evidence>

...

<dimensionN_evidence>
Quotes related to dimension N
</dimensionN_evidence>
```

[POSTERIOR UPDATE]
<posterior_probabilities>
For each dimension, describe how the evidence shifts the probabilities from the priors. Present the updated posterior probabilities in the same format as the priors.
</posterior_probabilities>

[FINAL DECISION]
For each dimension, select the category with the highest posterior probability as the final annotation. Justify why this category is best supported by the evidence.

[JSON OUTPUT]
Provide the final dimension scores in the pre-specified JSON schema.
