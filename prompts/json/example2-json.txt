EXAMPLE SPEECH 2:

S,07/08/1996,1040235725,Mr. SARBANES,Mr. President. I rise in support of the Kennedy amendment and. of course. in very strong support of the effort to raise the minimum wage. Historically. Congress has acted to guarantee minimum standards of decency for working Americans. The object of a Federal minimum wage is to make work pay well enough to keep families out of poverty and off of Government assistance. It is really an effort to ensure that any individual who works hard and plays by the rules should be assured of a standard of living for his or her family that is above the poverty line. It is very important to understand that this effort to provide a floor has marked our national policy now for almost six decades. I know many people think it is an imposition upon employers. but we had some interesting testimony this morning at a news conference from some small business people who came and testified in favor of the minimum wage. As one of the ladies who was there pointed out. they are caught by what their competitors do. Many of them would like to raise the wages of their workers oftheir own accord. but they have difficulty in doing this if their competitors do not do likewise. So they welcome a raise in the minimum wage because it. in effect. levels the playing field and ensures that the employer who is not concerned about providing a living wage for his employee will not dictate the standard of the industry. The minimum wage does not lift people very far. but it does lift them far enough so that there is the hope they will be able to work themselves out of poverty and stay off of dependency. It has been a national commitment now. as I said. for almost six decades. I think it is long past time to raise the minimum wage again. The minimum wage was last raised in 1989. if I am not mistaken. The minimum wage increase being proposed now is equivalent to what people got in 1989. In other words. the 1989 increase has. in effect. been used up by the rise in prices over the intervening 7 years. So you. in effect. are no better off at the minimum wage today than you were in 1989. when it was raised. In fact. the current level for the minimum wage in real terms--in other words. in purchasing poweris the lowest it has been in 40 years. Of course. this is at the very time. we are reading newspapers. magazines. and story after story about the incredible compensation the chief executives are receiving. Yet here we are. now. arguing about basic fairness and equity for the lowest paid workers. those at the very bottom of the pay scale. No one asserts that raising the minimum wage will correct everything. but it certainly will make an important difference to those who are on the low end of the income scale. It is argued. of course. that raising the minimum wage is going to cost jobs. Actually. there are studies that go both ways on this. Recently. there have been some very reputable studies that have found no evidence that the increase in wages results in reduced employment opportunities. One study in particular analyzed wage increases that were made in New Jersey and reached that conclusion. Others have found that during the late 1980s. moderate legislative increases did not reduce employment and were. if anything. associated with higher unemployment in some locales. Robert Solo. a distinguished Nobel laureate. distinguished professor of economics at MIT. was quoted in the New York Times as saying: The main thing about minimum wage research is that the evidence of job loss is weak and the fact that evidence is weak suggests that the impact on jobs is small. So I want to try to lay to one side this constant assertion that if you raise the minimum wage. you are going to cost a lot of people jobs. The counter to that. in addition to not costing them a lot of jobs. is that you will significantly improve the living standards of people receiving the minimum wage. Of course. as I have indicated. this is a twostep increase that is proposed in the KENNEDY amendment. a 45cent increase from $4.25 to $4.70 now and another 45cent increase from $4.70 to $5.15 in the middle of next year. So you would have a twostep process to take the minimum wage from $4.25 an hour to $5.15 an hour. Mr. President. I do not think we need a long argument about the equity and fairness of doing this. The statistics are very clear on that point. We know that people have been. in effect. slipping backward as a consequence of not raising the minimum wage now for 7 years. going on 8 years. this is the situation we are now confronting. But the real difficulty occurs in the amendment that is going to be offered by my colleagues on the other side. the Republican amendment. which they portray as their having a commitment to raising the minimum wage. but they just want to make some finetuning of it. Let us take a look at the finetuning. because it really is a shell game and the consequences of it would be very detrimental. First of all. they propose an exemption for employees who are on the job in the first 6 months. In other words. the first 180 days. you would get a subminimum wage. That is for workers of all ages. Previously. we have had a lesser wage for a very limited period of time for young workers. very limited. both in time and to the age group to which it applies. a socalled training wage. Unfortunately. a lot of training never took place. but. in any event. that was the theory of it. Now we are confronted with an exemption that would deny a minimum wage increase to all workersall workers--regardless of age or experience for the first 6 months of their employment with any employer. In effect. you could begin to create a permanent class of subminimum wage workers. In fact. at the lower wages. Workers are often changing jobs. They would be recirculated during this 180day exemption. They would be kept at $4.25. This is a very bad concept. and it opens up an incredible loophole that could be exploited in the law to violate the very spirit of raising the minimum wage. The other proposal. as I understand it. in the Republican amendment which will be offered by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. is to deny a minimum wage increase to employees in any company with less than $500.000 in annual revenues. So anyone who works in a company that has less than $500.000 in annual revenues--that is $10.000 a week in annual revenues. and we are talking now about anumber of small businesses. well over 10 million employeeswould be excluded altogether. They would just be exempted. Now. that means that many employees now covered by the minimum wage provisionsin other words. who receive the benefit of current law that requires they -be paid the minimum wagewould then be placed outside of the parameters with respect to any increases in the minimum wage. So. in effect. while asserting that they are extending the minimum wage on the one hand. they are taking it away on the other with respect to employees now covered in businesses that have revenues of less than $500.000 a year. and there are a significant number of such employeesin the millions. in the millions. So. for the first time since the minimum wage was instituted in the 1930s. we are actually reducing coverage in a significant and substantial manner. That is why so many of us are asserting that what we really ought to do is have a clean minimum wage bill. and that is what the President has indicated he very much wants. We have done that in the past in Republican and Democratic administrations.
S,07/08/1996,1040235726,The PRESIDING OFFICER,The Chair advises the Senator from Maryland that he has utilized his 10 minutes.
S,07/08/1996,1040235727,Mr. MOYNIHAN,I will be happy to yield another 5 minutes.
S,07/08/1996,1040235728,Mr. SARBANES,I appreciate it. So in the past. in both Democratic and Republican administrations. we have increased the minimum wage. We usually. have argued about how much to increase it and when to make it effective. and that usually has been the limit of the debate. Now we are confronted with a situation in which there is an effort to increase it. which. by every survey. commands overwhelming support amongst the American people. and then we are confronted with. as it were. the subterfuges which will erode the meaning of the extension in the minimum wage. The provision that I made reference to of a 180day period at the old wage for everyone. regardless of age. and for the exclusion from coverage of this increase in the minimum wage of any business with revenues of under $500.000 a year. many of the workers of such businesses are today covered under -the minimum wage law. But by the provisions of the amendment to be offered by my Republican colleagues. they would then be excluded. It ought not to be necessary to go through the really heartrending stories of people trying to make it on a minimum wage in order to see the decency of enacting this modest increase. Forty percent of those at minimum wage salaries are single parents trying to support their children. At a minimum wage today they have a yearround income of $8.500. This places them well below the poverty level. This effort here. of course. to raise the minimum wage and bring additional income to these families would help them to meet their bills and in effect to begin to see some light at the end of the tunnel. I know this measure is opposed by some of the small business associations. although I am interested to note that a number of small businesses are in support of this proposition. As I indicated. at a press conference earlier today. there was testimony by a number of owners of small businesses. in support of this measure. The decrease in the value of the minimum wage has served to widen the gulf between the wealthiest and the poorest in our society. In fact. as I indicated earlier. the real value of the minimum wage has deteriorated markedly. It will be at its lowest real value in the last 40 years if Congress fails to take action. In the late 1950s. in fact. the real value of the minimum wage was more than $5 an hour by todays standards. In the mid1960s it peaked at $6.28. If you were making the minimum wage in the mid1960s. to have that purchasing power today. you would have to have a minimum wage of $6.28 an hour. So it is not as though we are asking for some extraordinary thing here. It is not as though the increases that are being sought are out of some longterm trend. If anything. they are exceedingly modest. In the late 1950s. the minimum wage available then in purchasing power was better than $5 an hour at todays purchasing power levels. By the mid1960s it was $6.28 an hour. Congress has failed to respond to the erosion of the value of the minimum wage over time. We now confront the situation where $4.25 an hour in purchasing power is the least it has been in 40 years. More thai 70 percent of all minimum wage earners are 20 or above. The vast majority. about 60 percent. are women. many of them single heads of households. The time has come and gone for an increase in this minimum wage. It was last modestly raised in the Bush administration. I think obviously we need to raise it again. We need especially not to support this effort by my Republican colleagues in their amendment to carve out exemptions that. in effect. will render much of this meaningless. I mentioned two things: the exclusion of employees of businesses earning below $500.000 a year. which takes any increases in minimum wage protection away from workers now covered. a substantial number of wQrkers. I also mentioned. of course. the fact that there is. a subminimum wage for 180 days. for 6 months. Then. if that worker moves. because often those jobs come and go. they move into another lowwage job and get another 180 days at a subminimum wage. The third thing. which was not mentioned earlier in my references. is the effective date for the application of the minimum wage. The proposal of my Republican colleagues is to delay it until the beginning of next year. delay it for 6 months. in effect. This would obviously cost a minimum wage employee about $875 in the course of that period of time. just deny that increase. I defy anyone to make the case that someone should be able to support a family on $8.500 a year. which is what the current minimum wage works out to. $8.500 a year. So. Mr. President. I very much hope when the Senate comes to the vote. that the Republican amendment will be. rejected. that we will support the proposition put forward by the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senate will finally approve an increase in the minimum wage. which is so important for literally millions of workers and their families across our country. I thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding to me.
