Be sure to provide any evidence that would be consistent with EACH of the possible annotation scores for each dimension. Remember that scores MUST be integers.
In addition, adhere to the following principles:
1. **Use Double Quotes for Strings**:
   - Always use double quotes (`"`) for string values and property names in JSON.
   - Example: `"name": "John Doe"`

2. **Escape Special Characters**:
   - Escape any double quotes within string values using a backslash (`\`).
   - Example: `"quote": "She said, \"Hello!\""`

3. **Avoid Trailing Commas**:
   - Do not add a comma after the last item in an array or the last property in an object.
   - Correct: `{"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}`
   - Incorrect: `{"name": "John Doe", "age": 30,}`
